Trivia Thingy in Angular with Routing and shit

Well once I got rolling this was fun enough.  Man I love to procrastinate.  JT you requested the keys so here is my key: 13fPfYK2z8Pay-Spspj0GuvjazMIXFmwb-hrCGwhVLbQ

Routing certainly makes shit easy.  Not sure about this toaster service.  It's just neat it doesn't actually do anything.  Services are dope they are basically classes.
